Hello, this is a sample text file.

File handling allows Python programs to read, write, and modify files stored on your computer.

You can handle files in two main modes:

Text Mode (t): Reads/writes plain text files (default).
Binary Mode (b): Reads/writes binary files (images, videos, etc.).

Common File Modes:
"r"	Read mode (default) - Opens file for reading, error if file doesn't exist
"w"	Write mode - Creates a new file or overwrites existing content
"a"	Append mode - Adds new content without deleting old data
"x"	Exclusive Creation mode - Fails if file already exists
"rb" / "wb"	Read/Write in binary mode (for images, PDFs, etc.)
